\begin{abstract}
Many constraint solvers exist, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.
Users of constraint solvers have been expected to determine which solver is best for
the constraints they would like to solve and they must learn how to express the
constraints they would like to solve in the language that corresponds to the
solver they would like to use.

We designed and implemented \imss (Integration of Multiple String Solvers), a tool that
leverages the functionality of existing
constraint solvers to solve any constraint that existing solvers can solve in the
shortest amount of time. \imss translates the input
constraints and runs the constraint solvers it supports concurrently
to return satisfied or unsatisfied results to the user in the shortest amount of time.

\imss is lightweight and efficient, and can be easily enhanced to support
any constraint solver.
Our experiments use \imss with 3 renowned constraint solvers and compare each of
the constraint solvers' performance and results with other solvers.
\imss's source code, documentation, and the
experimental data are available on our project website~\cite{imss}.

%The language for \imss's input is expressive and efficient and can successfully
%represent any other constraint solver's language.
