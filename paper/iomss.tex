\input{abstract}
% Finished!

\input{introduction}
HiHi

\input{background}
% Wing & Ping
% Talk about the three solvers.
% Strengths and weaknesses of the solvers
% Statistics for number of tests for each solver

\input{approach}
% Finished!
% Ping
% Internal representation that we generate with our inputs and how we convert the
% representation to the three outputs. Provide an cool example if possible.
% Provide the list of commands we support if necessary/helpful.
% Translation for how we got our input (?)

\input{implementation}
% Finished!
% Ping

\input{evaluation}
% Wing
% Translation for how we got our input (?)
% Show the two charts.
% Show how some of DPRLE's tests do not work for DPRLE
% Timing for how some of Z3's tests takes almost 4 times longer
% to run on Hampi.
% All solvers reported correct output

\input{related}
% Finished!
% Wing
% Need to talk about SMT-lib, search on Google scholar for other similar projects to ours

\input{conclusion}
% Wing
% Should talk about future work somewhere
% 1) Complete translation of all of the solver's tests
% 2) Automatic translation the other solver's language to our language
% 3) Accepting SMT-Lib's format as input to support ALL solvers that support SMT-Lib
% 4) Adding other solvers such as Kaluza
% 5) Constraint Analyzer that uses heuristics to determine which solvers to only run
% 6) Use a constraint generator and test which solver is best at solving such constraints
