\section{conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We presented \imss, a solver for string constraints. \imss is the integration of
multiple solvers: \hampi, \dprle, and \zstr. \imss constraints can express
membership and string function such as replace, length, contains, and substring. The constraints
can contain arbitrary string variables, context-free language definitions, integers,
and regular language definitions. Given string constraints, \imss outputs
a string that satisfies the constraints, or reports that the constraints are incompatible.
By using \imss, users do not have to decide which solver from the three solvers
they should use to solve their constraints.

We evaluated \imss on the 131 derived tests we picked such that they contain all the functionalities
that the three solvers have together. Our experiment shows that \imss can solve all the tests
within a reasonable running time.

\dprle is the fastest solver, but it lacks of many functionalities. \zstr can solve
the most number of string constraints without context-free grammar definitions which only
\hampi supports.
