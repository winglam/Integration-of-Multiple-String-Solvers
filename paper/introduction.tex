\textbf{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We implement \imss, a string constraint solver that utilizes three constraint solvers:
    \hampi, \dprle, and \zstr. \imss's source code and documentation can be downloaded at
    \url{https://github.com/winglam/Integration-of-Multiple-String-Solvers/}.
    \item Experimental evalution for various constraints derived from the three solvers' tests.
\end{itemize}

In this paper, we provide some background about terms we use in the paper to have
a better understanding (Section~\ref{sec:background}), then introduce \imss along with
our approach and an example (Section~\ref{sec:approach}), explain in-depth the
implementation of \imss (Section~\ref{sec:implementation}), and present the evaluation
result (Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}). Lastly, we finish with related work
(Section~\ref{sec:related}) and conclusion (Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}).
